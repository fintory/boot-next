# boot-next / Components

Components are globally(*!!!*) usable elements on either page, section or layout. There is no further explanation needed on what goes into a component and what doesn't, but to give you an example, the following is pretty common:

```bash
components
├── Navbar.tsx
├── Footer.tsx
├── Layout.tsx
└── Button.tsx
```
