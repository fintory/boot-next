You can use this boilerplate very easily. Just follow the following steps:

## Using the GitHub template

### Step 1: "Use this template"

![](/img/github-template-screenshot.png)

### Step 2: Enter all preferences of your new project

In the screen the page is referring you to, you are seeing a form, where you need to name the repository and specify whether the project is public or private.

Please be careful with public repositories.

### Step 3: Remove unused folders

If you want to keep the project clean, and don't want to document everything you do in the new project, you are free to remove some folders. You can have a look at the "[Project Structure](./project-structure.md)" document, whether the folder is safe to remove or not.
